A responsive D3-based data visualization that leverages a <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/sankey.html">Sankey diagram</a> to display the breakdown of the worldwide COVID-19 cases.

This visualization uses a JSON endpoints provide by [@pomber](https://github.com/pomber/covid19/) and [@NovelCOVID](https://github.com/NovelCOVID/API) which serves data derived from the [Johns Hopkins Center of Systems Science and Engineering dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

## Contributing

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification and contributions of all kinds are welcome!

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/LonnyGomes/covid-sankey-vizualization/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request.abs

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Recognizing contributions

You don't have to land commits to be considered a contributor to this project. We aim to recognize all contributions, and use the `all-contributors` tooling to help with this. You can submit yourself as a contributor by forking this repository and run the following command:

```bash
npm run contributors:add <github_username> <contribution_type>
```

> **NOTE:** Refer to the [Emojoi Key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) to discover the possible `contribution_types`.
